## Introduction

The **4CPP MODULE** project is designed to help students develop their skills in C++ through a series of progressively challenging exercises. Each day's challenge is intended to build upon the previous one, gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories for each challenge:

```CPP MODULE/
├── C00/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ ├── Makefile
│ └── other.cpp
├── C01/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ ├── Makefile
│ └── other.cpp
└── ...
```
- `C00/`, `C01/`, ...: Directories for each challenge.
- `main.cpp`: The main source file for the day s challenge.
- `Makefile`: Contains build instructions.
- `other.cpp`: other help file <headers classes ...>.


## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/42_CPP_Days.git
   cd 42_CPP_Days
   cd C0..
   make
   ```
   
## Usage

After building the project, you can run the executable to test the challenge. The name of the executable is usually specified in the Makefile. For example:

```sh

./executable_name
```

Replace executable_name with the actual name given in the Makefile.
